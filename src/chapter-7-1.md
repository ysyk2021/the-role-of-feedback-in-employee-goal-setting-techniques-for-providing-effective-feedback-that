Effective goal setting is critical for driving performance and achieving organizational goals. In this chapter, we will explore the benefits of incorporating ongoing feedback into goal setting.

What is Ongoing Feedback?
-------------------------

Ongoing feedback is feedback that is provided on a regular basis throughout the year, rather than just during an annual performance review. Ongoing feedback can be provided by managers, colleagues, mentors, or even through self-assessment.

By incorporating ongoing feedback into goal setting, individuals can receive timely insights into their progress towards achieving their goals and make adjustments as needed to stay on track.

Benefits of Ongoing Feedback

Incorporating ongoing feedback into goal setting has several benefits, including:

* **Increased motivation**: Ongoing feedback can help individuals stay motivated and focused on their goals by providing regular insights into their progress.
* **Improved performance**: By receiving ongoing feedback, individuals can make adjustments and improvements more frequently, leading to improved overall performance.
* **Better alignment with organizational goals**: Ongoing feedback can help ensure that individual goals are aligned with organizational strategy and objectives.
* **Opportunities for course correction**: By receiving ongoing feedback, individuals can identify areas where they need to make adjustments and course correct before it's too late.
* **Development of growth mindset**: Ongoing feedback can help individuals cultivate a growth mindset by viewing feedback as an opportunity for learning and development.

By incorporating ongoing feedback into goal setting, individuals can achieve their goals more effectively and support organizational success.

Techniques for Providing Ongoing Feedback
-----------------------------------------

To provide ongoing feedback effectively, individuals can use the following techniques:

* **Be timely**: Provide feedback as soon as possible after an event or behavior occurs, rather than waiting until a scheduled review.
* **Be specific**: Provide feedback that is specific and objective, focusing on behaviors or actions rather than personal traits.
* **Be actionable**: Provide guidance on what individuals can do to improve their performance and achieve their goals.
* **Be supportive**: Use language that is supportive and encourages growth and development, rather than judgmental or accusatory.

By using these techniques, individuals can provide ongoing feedback that supports growth, development, and high performance.
